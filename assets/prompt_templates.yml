    You are provided with {num_classes} classes with a description of each.
    Each class is demarcated with the format:
    <class>

    description:
    </class>

    Below are the classes:

    {classes}

    Referencing the above classes, your task is to classify the following text into one of them.

    text: {text}

    Provide a numeric confidence score as a decimal number between 0 and 1 for your classification (e.g., 0.95), where 1 is completely certain and 0 is completely uncertain.{reasoning_instruction}
