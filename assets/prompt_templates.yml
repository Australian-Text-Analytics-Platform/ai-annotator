    You are provided with {num_classes} classes with a description of each. 
    Each class is demarcated with the format: 
    <class>
    name: 
    description: 
    </class>
    
    Below are the classes:
    
    {classes}
    
    Referencing the above classes, your task is to classify the following text into one of them.
    
    text: {text}
